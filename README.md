# email-spam-classifier-
Email Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes Multinomial Algorithm  This is a simple email spam classifier built using the Naive Bayes Multinomial algorithm. The classifier takes an email message as input and predicts whether it is spam or not.
Prerequisites
Before running this program, you need to have the following installed:

Python 3
NumPy
Scikit-learn

Email spam classification is a popular application of machine learning that involves classifying emails as either spam or legitimate (ham). The goal of this project is to develop an email spam classifier using the Naive Bayes Multinomial algorithm. The classifier will be trained on a dataset of pre-labeled emails that are either spam or ham.

The project will involve the following steps:

Data Collection: Collect a dataset of pre-labeled emails that are either spam or ham.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the email data to remove any unwanted information such as special characters, numbers, and stop words. This step also involves tokenizing the email text, stemming, and normalizing the text data.

Feature Extraction: Use a feature extraction technique such as Bag of Words or TF-IDF to convert the preprocessed email text into numerical features that can be used by the Naive Bayes algorithm.

Model Selection: Use the Naive Bayes Multinomial algorithm to train a classification model on the preprocessed and feature extracted data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step also involves performing cross-validation to ensure that the model is not overfitting on the training data.

Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model to classify new, unseen email data as either spam or ham.

This project will require knowledge of Python programming and machine learning concepts such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, and evaluation. The project can be implemented using popular Python libraries such as Scikit-Learn and NLTK.
